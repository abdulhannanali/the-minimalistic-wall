# The Minimalistic Wall

Idea with this project is a simple Firebase Project making use of Realtime Database Triggers in 
Firebase function-*s, to construct a wall similar to what we have with Facebook, although a very
simpler one, displaying Posts sorted by time. 

This Minimalistic wall will be built to demonstrate the use of following concepts:
 - Our use of Firebase Function Triggers
 - ReactJS
 - Realtime Database.

Sorting should be simple and should not bother a lot. For design we can use something such as 
[Material Design Lite](getmdl.io) which we haven't used in our any project till now.

This will be one of it's kind projects, with the design based on Simplicity. A simple wall which allows to post statuses. We can also use Triggers to sanitize and moderate bad stuff. 

Better rules for 

Following functions can be integrated initially with the project:
 - Moderation the text
 - Likes Count
 - Verifying the likes Count
 
 Maybe functions, I might or might not implement the ones listed here, depending on the time available
 - Email Verification
 - Emojifying the text using the Meownica's library

The database permission rules should be totally suitable on what we intend 
to build and they should be well researched in order to eliminate any loop holes
there are regarding the functionality we are building.  

Functions we can perform using The Minimalistic Wall.

Simple functions we can perform are listed here.
- Authenticate by user
- Post statuses to the public Minimalistic Wall
- Like statuses
- Follow other users
- Add Firebase messaging when someone follows 

Website design, we can just use Bootstrap for Website design
as it'll help us save time, and we want to do other projects too.
